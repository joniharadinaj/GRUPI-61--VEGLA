# Basic Calculator Functions in C++

## 📌 Description
This project is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the use of **functions** to perform basic mathematical operations.  
Each operation is implemented in a separate function and called from the `main()` function.

The program outputs the results directly to the console.

---

## 🧮 Features
The program includes the following operations:

- Subtraction
- Addition (Sum)
- Power calculation
- Modulo operation
- Maximum of two numbers
- Minimum of two numbers
- Multiplication
- Division (with division-by-zero check)

## 🛠️ Functions Overview

- `subtract(int a, int b)` – returns the difference of two numbers  
- `sum(int a, int b)` – returns the sum of two numbers  
- `power(int base, int exp)` – calculates power using `pow()`  
- `modulo(int a, int b)` – returns the remainder  
- `maxNumber(int a, int b)` – returns the larger number  
- `minNumber(int a, int b)` – returns the smaller number  
- `multiply(int a, int b)` – returns the product  
- `divide(int a, int b)` – returns the division result and handles division by zero
